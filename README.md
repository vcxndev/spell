# SPELL

## About it 

This is a simple command-line spelling app for **TURKISH** (I have not tried it with other languages) that I made because my teacher wanted me to do it. I have not tested it with any kind of dictionary.

## How to I use it? 

It takes in only one input word but probably you can change that easily if you are not a complete beginner but I am lazy so it is up to you.

The command is just:

```
./spell (the word that you want to be spelled)
```

# FAQ

>Why did you write the README.md in English if the program only spells Turkish words?

idk.

>How did you come up with the algorithm?

Probably there is a LOT of resources out there but I just thought about it consistently for a whole school day.

>Can I use it in my project?

Why would you? You could probably do a better implementation or use a dictionary.
